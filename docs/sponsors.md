# Become a Stacks.js Sponsor

Stacks.js is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

## How to Sponsor

Sponsorships can be done via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/chrisbbreuer) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/stacksjs). Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system. Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in Sponsorship Tiers.

If you have questions regarding tiers, payment logistics, or sponsor exposure data, please reach out to <sponsor@stacksjs.org>.

The following companies and organizations are supporting Stacks development through sponsorships:

## Sponsoring Stacks as a Business

Sponsoring Stacks gives you developer exposure around the world through our website and GitHub project READMEs. This not only directly generates leads, but also improves your brand recognition as a business that cares about Open Source. This is an intangible but extremely important asset for companies building products for developers, as it improves your conversion rate.

If you are using Stacks to build a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Stacks's development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. The exposure and positive brand image in the Stacks community also makes it easier to attract and recruit Stacks developers.

If you are building a product where your target customers are developers, you will gain high quality traffic through the sponsorship exposure, since all our visitors are developers. The sponsorship also builds brand recognition and improves conversion.

## Sponsoring Stacks as an Individual

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Stacks, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying us coffee once in a while. Many of our team members accept sponsorships and donations via GitHub Sponsors. Look for the "Sponsor" button on each team member's profile on our [team page](https://stacksjs-docs.netlify.app/team).

You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor Stacks as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.
